# Stencil

For designing mockups with [Nunjucks](http://jlongster.github.io/nunjucks/)
and [Sass](https://github.com/andrew/node-sass).

## Getting Started

To install:

    npm install

To run:

    npm start

Any assets added or changed in the `src/` directory will be automatically compiled,
added to the `build/` directory, then served by [BrowserSync][bs] for live reloading.

[bs]: http://browsersync.io

**PS**: If you want to trigger a build manually (without using the server),
simply run:

    npm run build
