# Stencil

For designing mockups with [Nunjucks](http://jlongster.github.io/nunjucks/) and [Sass](https://github.com/andrew/node-sass).

## Getting Started

To install:

    npm install

To run:

    npm start

Any assets added/changed in the `src/` directory will be automatically compiled
and added to the `build/` directory (which is served by
[Connect](http://www.senchalabs.org/connect/)).

**PS**: If you want to trigger a build manually(without using the server),
simply run:

    npm run build

## Roadmap
